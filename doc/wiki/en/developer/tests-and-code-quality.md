# Tests and Code Quality

Use this page when you modify source code, add a regression test, want to reproduce CI results locally, or need to confirm the code-style requirements. It documents the `test/` directory and its conventions, the commands for running tests locally, the `ruff` code-style configuration, and the CI quality gates defined by `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.

This guide does not cover packaging and release (see [Packaging and release](./packaging-and-release.md)), code layering and module boundaries (see [Architecture and code boundaries](./architecture-and-code-boundaries.md)), or the full steps for adding a feature (see [Adding or changing a feature](./adding-or-changing-a-feature.md)).

## Relevant code

- Test directory and conventions: the `test/` layout rules, and the roles of `test/README.md` and `test/_bootstrap.py`.
- Running tests locally: `uv` dependency sync, `pytest` invocation, and the pytest `testpaths`/`pythonpath` configuration.
- Code style: the rules in `desktop_qt_ui/ruff.toml`, the local self-check command, and its relationship to CI.
- CI quality gates: the triggers, steps, and environment variables of `tests.yml`, plus its boundary with the docs, packaging, Docker, and mirror-sync workflows.
- The desktop "Test Current Tab" (`Test Current Tab`) connection test belongs to API management; this guide only cites its i18n copy, while the full workflow lives on the API-management pages.

## Test directory and conventions

`test/` holds local tests and temporary regression scripts. The `.gitignore` rule is `/test/**` combined with `!/test/*.py`: only `.py` files directly under `test/` are tracked, while output images, temporary JSON, and files in subdirectories are ignored. Production code must not depend on anything in `test/`.

- Prefer pytest-style `test_*` test functions; every script should also run directly: `python test/<script>.py`.
- Scripts that use Qt or repository code must start with `import _bootstrap  # noqa: F401` as the first import.
- Prefer `pytest-qt` and `qtbot` for Qt widget tests (recommended by `test/README.md`; `pyproject.toml` does not currently declare `pytest-qt`, so fall back to direct script execution when it is not installed).
- 52 `test/*.py` files are currently tracked, 39 of them pytest-style `test_*.py` (verified with `git ls-files` on 2026-08-07).

`test/_bootstrap.py` centralizes the three things every test author must remember:

1. Add the repository root and `desktop_qt_ui` to `sys.path` (otherwise `No module named 'editor' / 'services'`).
2. Set `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` before any PyQt6 import.
3. Load torch before PyQt6: on Windows, PyQt6's Qt DLL search path overrides `c10.dll` dependency resolution, and the reverse import order fails with `OSError: [WinError 1114] 动态链接库(DLL)初始化例程失败`. The desktop entry point `desktop_qt_ui/main.py` does the same (see pytorch#166628).

    E --> G["Then import PyQt6 / repo modules"]

```

## Running tests locally

The repository is based on Python 3.12 (`requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.13"` in `pyproject.toml`) and dependencies are managed with `uv`. CI uses the CPU dependency group, so prefer matching it locally:

```powershell
uv sync --no-default-groups --group cpu --group test
uv run --no-sync pytest test
```

- The default `uv sync` installs `cuda13.0` + `packaging` + `test` (NVIDIA CUDA 13.0, PyInstaller, and test tools). The `cuda12.6` group provides the CUDA 12.6 environment from the same source branch. The installer disables default groups, so it does not check test dependencies. The `cpu`, `cuda13.0`, `cuda12.6`, `rocm7.2.1`, and `metal` groups are mutually exclusive via `[tool.uv] conflicts` in `pyproject.toml`.
- `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` in `pyproject.toml` fixes `testpaths = ["test"]` and `pythonpath = [".", "desktop_qt_ui"]`, preventing pytest from inheriting configuration and source paths from an adjacent older repository.
- When running the full suite, the pytest-reported `rootdir` must be the current Git repository root. If an older repository still exists in a parent directory, stale configuration can import the old `manga_translator` (e.g. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rusty_manga_image_translator'`); in that case verify the actual import path with `PYTHONPATH=.` first, and never report an adjacent repository's results as this repository's.
- Verified in this workspace on 2026-08-07: `uv run --no-sync pytest test --collect-only -q` collected 379 tests in about 26 seconds. This task did not run the full suite; CI owns the full run.

## Writing tests

- Start with `import _bootstrap  # noqa: F401`; build every test path from `_bootstrap.ROOT` instead of the current working directory (the cwd differs when launching from an IDE, PowerShell, or pytest).
- Put dependency replacements inside test functions or fixtures using `monkeypatch`, `unittest.mock.patch`, or another automatically restoring mechanism.
- Test modules must not write, delete, or bulk-mutate `sys.modules` at module level; `test_test_collection_isolation.py` scans and enforces this.
- Manage Qt widgets with `qtbot.addWidget(widget)` and prefer `qtbot.waitUntil(...)` / `qtbot.wait(...)` over bare `time.sleep()`; keep a module-level `QApplication` reference, because creating widgets after it is garbage-collected crashes the process.
- Production `except Exception: logger.error(...)` blocks swallow the `AttributeError` of a fake object missing a method, so failures look like "nothing happened"; if an assertion does not match, replace the fake logger with one that prints a traceback.
- When `ServiceManager`, caches, or temporary directories are involved, define initialization and cleanup boundaries inside the script; do not reuse real global service state without cleanup.
- Scripts that support both pytest and direct execution keep `if __name__ == "__main__": raise SystemExit(main())` at the bottom.
- Test behavior, not implementation details; name regression tests specifically, e.g. `test_region_list_preserves_dirty_translation_by_region_id`.

## Lint and code style

The only tracked static-analysis configuration is `desktop_qt_ui/ruff.toml` (verified with `git ls-files`: there is no `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini`, `.flake8`, or second `ruff.toml`, and `pyproject.toml` has no lint section). Its contents:

```toml
[lint]
select = ["E", "F", "I"]
ignore = ["E501", "E701", "E402"]
[format]
quote-style = "double"
```

Local self-check command (`ruff` is not declared in `pyproject.toml`, so install it separately):

```powershell
ruff check desktop_qt_ui manga_translator --config desktop_qt_ui/ruff.toml
```

Boundary note: `.github/workflows/tests.yml` currently has no explicit lint step, so the command above is a local self-check entry point, not a gate that CI currently enforces.

## CI and quality gates

`.github/workflows/tests.yml` (workflow name `Tests`) is the full-suite quality gate: every `push`, `pull_request`, and manual `workflow_dispatch` triggers it, and a new run for the same ref cancels the in-progress run (`concurrency.cancel-in-progress: true`). The `pytest` job runs on `windows-latest` with a 30-minute timeout and the environment variables `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` and `PYTHONUTF8=1`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["push / pull_request / workflow_dispatch"] --> B["actions/checkout"]
    B --> C["setup-uv v0.11.33\ncache uv.lock"]
    C --> D["uv python install 3.12"]
    D --> E["uv sync --locked --no-default-groups --group cpu --group test"]
    E --> F["uv run --no-sync pytest test"]
```

Other workflows and their relationship to the quality gates:

| Workflow | Trigger | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/tests.yml` | push / pull_request / workflow_dispatch | Full pytest suite (Windows, Python 3.12, CPU) |

## Test coverage overview

The table groups the currently tracked test files by area; it is not a coverage percentage (the repository does not wire a coverage tool into the test command or CI).

## Constraints and notes

- The `cpu` / `cuda13.0` / `cuda12.6` / `rocm7.2.1` / `metal` groups are mutually exclusive and cannot be installed together; CI and the commands on this page use `cpu` + `test`. The default `uv sync` is `cuda13.0` + `packaging` + `test`, so running tests on a machine without an NVIDIA environment may behave differently due to the torch backend.
- `uv.lock` is a committed lockfile that must not be hand-edited; CI uses `uv sync --locked` for reproducibility.
- On Windows, torch must load before PyQt6; `_bootstrap.py` handles this, so do not `import torch` yourself or assume "my test does not use torch".
- Only `test/*.py` is tracked; output images, temporary JSON, and subdirectory files are ignored. Do not treat ignored temporary artifacts as official test results, and do not modify `.gitignore` to un-ignore them.
- Tests and documentation never read real `.env`, user `config.json`, API keys, user images, or private prompts; the security regression test specifically verifies that path traversal and remote image URLs are rejected.
- The coverage overview is a file grouping, not proof that every feature is covered; the page claims no coverage percentage.

#### Connection-test UI copy

The desktop app has no "run the test suite" button; the closest testing UI is the "Test Current Tab" (`Test Current Tab`) connection test on the API-management page. The following i18n strings appear while a developer checks credentials; when a key differs from its final display text, use the actual value. The full workflow is documented on the API-management pages.

| UI call key | English actual value | Simplified Chinese actual value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Test` | Test | 测试 |
| `Test Current Tab` | Test Current Tab | 测试当前页 |
| `Testing` | Testing | 测试中 |
| `API connection test successful!` | API connection test successful! | API连接测试成功！ |
| `API connection test failed` | API connection test failed | API连接测试失败 |
| `No API channels to test` | No API channels to test | 没有可测试的 API 通道 |
| `API test available` | available | 可用 |
| `API test unavailable` | unavailable | 不可用 |
| `Open log folder` | Open log folder | 打开日志文件夹 |
| `Log output...` | Log output... | 日志输出... |
