# Architecture and Code Boundaries

Use this page before modifying or debugging a feature to locate which layer it belongs to and which module boundaries it crosses. The repository consists of two packages: `desktop_qt_ui` (PyQt6 desktop app) and `manga_translator` (core engine, CLI, and server). The desktop app and the CLI `local` mode share the same `MangaTranslator` pipeline; the web, shared, and WebSocket modes reuse the same core with different entry points and transports. This guide only maps module boundaries and call relationships; it does not repeat the operations or parameters of individual features (see the corresponding feature pages).

## Relevant code

- `desktop_qt_ui` is responsible for the UI, i18n, file lists, settings persistence, and task orchestration; it does not implement detection, OCR, translation, or rendering algorithms.
- `manga_translator` is responsible for the config model, processing pipeline, per-stage implementations, and API calls; it contains no Qt windows, but `rendering` text layout depends on PyQt6 offscreen rendering.
- Desktop `TranslationWorker`, CLI `local`, shared `shared`, WebSocket `ws`, and the web server all instantiate `manga_translator.manga_translator.MangaTranslator`; they differ only in parameter source, progress reporting, and result transport.
- The web-server mode does not own a translator instance directly: `server/core/task_manager.py` limits concurrency with a semaphore, and `translation_integration` wraps core calls with permission, quota, history, and logging.
- Do not collapse "translator selection", "API feature selector", "API slot rotation", and `translator_chain` into one layer: they belong to the desktop translator pages, the API-management pages, and the core `runtime_api_resolver.py` / `api_key_rotation.py` respectively.

## How to use it

### Observe module entry points in the desktop app

After launching the desktop app, the left navigation registers the seven main pages in `desktop_qt_ui/ui/main_window.py`, plus the editor view. Each main page is an independent constructor under `ui/main_page/pages/`, created by `MainView` and hosted by `FluentWindow`.

### Workflow mode selector

The "Translation Workflow Mode:" combo box on the translation page maps one selection to a single workflow boolean field in the `cli` config (`runtime.py#on_workflow_mode_changed` clears all flags first, then sets one). It is the direct entry point for observing the "UI state -> core parameter" boundary.

The combo box only changes the eight `cli` booleans; the actual behavior differences come from the branches in core `translate_batch()` (see [Workflow and file modes](../cli/workflow-and-file-modes.md)).

## Layers and module boundaries

    end
    subgraph Core["manga_translator · Core engine"]
        CFG["config.py · Config and stage settings"]
        MT["manga_translator.py · MangaTranslator pipeline"]
        STAGE["detection/ ocr/ inpainting/ mask_refinement/ rendering/ colorization/ upscaling/ textline_merge/"]
        TR["translators/ · translators and prompts"]
        API["runtime_api_resolver.py + api_key_rotation.py"]
    end
    subgraph Entry["Runtime entry points"]
        CLI["__main__.py + mode/local.py"]
        SHARE["mode/share.py · HTTP"]
        WS["mode/ws.py · WebSocket"]
        WEB["server/main.py · FastAPI + task_manager"]
    end

    MT --> TR

    WEB --> MT
```

The solid arrows are direct calls in source: the desktop `TranslationWorker` constructs `MangaTranslator` and calls `translate_batch()`; every stage module exposes `get_*`, `prepare()`, and `dispatch()` (and some `unload()`) consistently. `config.py` is the single core configuration source, and `desktop_qt_ui/core/config_models.py` `AppSettings` is the Qt-side mirror model; their keys are not one-to-one.

## Call relationships

### Standard per-image pipeline

`translate_batch()` advances stages in a fixed order per image; colorization and upscaling run conditionally, and whether the remaining stages run depends on detection/OCR results:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Colorize (conditional)"] --> B["Upscale (conditional)"]
    B --> C["Detection"]
    C --> D["OCR"]
    D --> E["Textline merge"]
    E --> F["Translation (batch dispatch)"]
    F --> G["Mask refinement"]
    G --> H["Inpainting"]
    H --> I["Text rendering"]
    I --> J["Save output"]
```

### Three non-desktop entry points

`local`, `shared`, and `ws` share the same `MangaTranslator` as the desktop app: `local` reuses the desktop `FileService` to collect inputs; `shared` exposes an HTTP interface on port 5003; `ws` hands images and config to the core over WebSocket. The `web` server mode calls the core through `task_manager` + `translation_integration` and runs the translator instance in a thread pool so the FastAPI event loop is not blocked.

## Constraints and notes

- The desktop app imports `manga_translator` directly (e.g., `app_logic.py`, `mode/local.py`); changing a core public interface requires checking desktop, CLI, and server callers at the same time.
- `rendering` depends on PyQt6 offscreen rendering, and the server and shared modes use the same rendering implementation; headless environments must provide Qt platform plugins themselves, which is not a module-boundary issue.
- `.env` is loaded by each entry point at startup and `runtime_api_resolver` only reads environment variables; never write real keys into config files or documentation.
- `batch_concurrent` only applies to the "Normal Translation" workflow; import/export, colorize-only, upscale-only, inpaint-only, and replace-translation force the sequential pipeline.
- Server concurrency is limited by the `task_manager` semaphore; desktop concurrency is limited by the `TranslationWorker` QRunnable thread pool. The two do not know about each other.

### Mermaid diagram limits

The diagrams above show layers and call relationships, not "every request passes through every node". Special workflows (export original text, colorize-only, replace translation, etc.) skip most stages; with `batch_concurrent` enabled, detection, OCR, translation, and inpainting advance in parallel, and no real keys are included.
