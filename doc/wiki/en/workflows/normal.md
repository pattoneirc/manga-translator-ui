# Normal Translation

"Normal Translation" is the default choice of the "Translation Workflow Mode:" combo box on the translation page and the only one of the nine workflows that runs the full translation chain. Use this mode when you want to detect text on images, recognize and translate it, inpaint the original text areas, and render the translation; the other eight modes skip most of these stages, see [Output Directory and Workflow](../desktop/translation/output-directory-and-workflow.md) for the overview.

This guide focuses on the inputs, full processing stages, skip conditions, and output files of the normal mode. Adding files, list states, and drag-and-drop are covered by [File List and Input](../desktop/translation/file-list-and-input.md); start, stop, cancel, and progress states by [Progress, Stop, and Task State](../desktop/translation/progress-stop-and-task-state.md); and the parameter algorithms of each stage by the corresponding settings pages (Detection, OCR Filter and Merge, Translation, Mask and Inpainting, Typesetting and Rendering, Upscale and Colorization, CLI Batch and Output).

## When to use it

- Input: main input images added with "Add Files", "Add Folder", or drag-and-drop. When a folder is added, the supported image extensions are discovered recursively, collected in natural sort order, and directories named `manga_translator_work` are skipped.
- Processing stages: conditional colorization → conditional upscaling → detection → OCR → textline merge → translation → mask refinement → inpainting → rendering → saving the main output image.
- Skip conditions: no textlines after detection, no text after OCR, empty regions after translation, cancellation, and AI-renderer inpainting skip, as listed under "Skip conditions" below.
- Outputs: the main output image; the project JSON and inpainted image when `cli.save_text` (the "Editable Image" UI setting) is enabled; and an editor base image when colorization or upscaling is enabled.
- Normal mode is the only one of the nine workflows allowed to enter the `batch_concurrent` concurrent pipeline; the other eight are treated as incompatible in both the desktop controller and the core `translate_batch()` and run non-concurrently.
- This guide does not explain the parameter algorithms of individual detectors, OCR engines, translators, inpainting models, or renderers; those belong to the settings pages. The workflow combo box, output-directory controls, and the mutually exclusive writes of the nine modes are covered by [Output Directory and Workflow](../desktop/translation/output-directory-and-workflow.md).

## Run this workflow

### Add inputs and select the workflow

1. Open the "Translation" tab. The header title defaults to "Normal Translation", with the subtitle "Tip: Standard translation pipeline with detection, OCR, translation and rendering".
2. Click "Add Files" or "Add Folder" to add images, or drop files/folders onto the page; click "Clear List" to clear the current list.
3. In the "Translation Workflow Mode:" combo box, confirm that "Normal Translation" is selected. Changing the combo box first clears all eight mutually exclusive workflow fields, then sets and saves only the field for the selected mode; normal mode leaves all eight fields `false`.
4. Enter a path in the "Output Directory:" field or drag an output folder into it; the placeholder is "Select or drag output folder...". Click "Browse..." to choose a directory, or "Open" to open the selected directory with the operating system.
5. Click "Start Translation" to start the task. While running, the button text changes to "Stop Translation"; clicking it again requests a stop, and the button then enters the "Stopping..." state.

## Processing order

### Main pipeline

Normal mode processes each image in the order below; whether colorization, upscaling, or inpainting actually happens is decided by the corresponding parameters, not forced by the mode. When detection finds no textlines or OCR recognizes no text, the image returns early and the remaining stages are skipped.

```

The diagram expresses the stage order, skip branches, and output branches; it does not claim every run passes every stage. `colorizer.colorizer=none`, an empty `upscale_ratio`, no text, an AI renderer, and cancellation each take their documented bypass. The inpainted and editor base images are written only under the listed conditions.

### Skip conditions

| Condition | Trigger point | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No textlines after detection (`textlines` empty) | After detection in `_translate_until_translation()` | Progress status `skip-no-regions`; result set to the input or upscaled image; OCR, translation, mask refinement, inpainting, and rendering are skipped |
| No text after OCR (`textlines` empty) | After OCR in the same function | Progress status `skip-no-text`; result set to the input or upscaled image; translation and rendering are skipped |
| `text_regions` empty after translation | `_complete_translation_pipeline()` | Progress status `error-translating`; result set to the input or upscaled image |
| Translation returns `cancel` | Same function | Progress status `cancelled`; result set to the input or upscaled image |
| `renderer` is an AI renderer (`openai_renderer` / `gemini_renderer`) | Inpainting step | Inpainting is skipped; the work image is used as the render base |
| Mask empty or all zero | Inpainting step | Inpainting is skipped; `img_inpainted = img_rgb` |
| `revert_upscaling=true` | Before saving | Progress status `downscaling`; the result is resized back to the input size |

"Input or upscaled image" means that on an early no-text return `ctx.result = ctx.upscaled`, and with `revert_upscaling` enabled it is then resized back to the original size. `cli.skip_no_text` (the "Skip Images Without Text" UI setting) is a stored CLI field; the the current code shows no consumer of it on the main translation path. The built-in early exit for textless images is triggered by the `skip-no-regions` / `skip-no-text` states; whether the two interact remains a runtime item.

### Outputs and file writes

- Main output image: determined by `_calculate_output_path()`, which preserves the input folder name and relative hierarchy under the output directory; with `save_to_source_dir=true` (the "Save to Source Directory" UI setting) the output moves to `manga_translator_work/result/` next to the source image; an empty or `none` `cli.format` keeps the original extension, otherwise the configured extension is used. Saving goes through `_save_and_cleanup_context()`.
- Project JSON: when `save_text` (the "Editable Image" UI setting) or `text_output_file` is enabled, `manga_translator_work/json/<stem>_translations.json` is written with `regions`, `original_width`, `original_height`, the `mask_raw` mask (when `save_mask` is enabled), upscale/colorization information, and rendered-state flags; this is the basis for later "Import Translation and Render" and editor write-back.
- Inpainted image: when `save_text` is enabled and the image has an `img_inpainted`, `manga_translator_work/inpainted/<stem>_inpainted.<original-extension>` is written; when an AI renderer skips inpainting, the saved file is the work image.
- Editor base image: when colorization or upscaling is enabled, `manga_translator_work/editor_base/<original-filename>` is written as the editable base for the editor.
- `cli.overwrite` (the "Overwrite Existing Files" UI setting): when `false`, the GUI filters files before starting by checking whether the main output image already exists; if all files are skipped, the task ends before translation and asks the user to delete same-named files or enable overwrite.

## Inputs, outputs, and limitations

- `batch_size` and `batch_concurrent`: normal mode is the only workflow allowed to use the concurrent pipeline; the other eight modes are treated as incompatible in both the desktop controller and the core `translate_batch()` and are forced to run non-concurrently. Concurrency does not mean all images request the API at once; stage-level parallelism, backpressure, and failure isolation are covered by [CLI Batch and Output](../desktop/settings/cli-batch-and-output.md).
- `cli.save_text`: controls project JSON and inpainted-image writes in normal mode as well; the default is `true`.
- Whether colorization, upscaling, detection, OCR, inpainting, and rendering actually run is decided by their parameters (for example `colorizer.colorizer`, `upscale.upscale_ratio`, `render.renderer`); see the settings pages.
- Context pages, glossary, replacement rules, API-candidate rotation, and retries affect translation and rendering quality but do not change the stage order of normal mode.
- The exact dialog text for a missing, unwritable, or unopenable output directory has not been runtime-checked; static conclusions are not presented as runtime results.
