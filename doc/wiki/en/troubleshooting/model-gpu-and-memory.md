# Model, GPU, and Memory Troubleshooting

Use this page when a task stalls on model download, reports “CUDA out of memory”, GPU mode will not start, or memory/VRAM does not drop after translation. It covers model loading, GPU devices, VRAM, and RAM. Hardware backend groups are installed separately; see [Runtime Requirements](../install/requirements.md). The switches such as `app.unload_models_after_translation` are documented in [General and App Settings](../desktop/settings/general-and-app.md). This guide does not repeat the full parameter pages for translation, OCR, detection, inpainting, or upscaling, nor API auth and rate limiting (see [API Auth, Rate Limit, and Timeout](./api-auth-rate-limit-and-timeout.md)) or CLI subprocess whole-machine memory limits (see [Subprocess, Memory, and Recovery](../cli/subprocess-memory-and-recovery.md)).

## Identify the problem {#feature-boundary}

- This guide covers: model download/verification failures, device selection for `cli.use_gpu`, the ONNX path for `cli.disable_onnx_gpu`, post-task unload via `app.unload_models_after_translation`, and VRAM-related remedies such as `inpainting_size` and `tile_size`.
- This guide does not cover: how to choose installation dependency groups (see `install/requirements.md`), the full options of the inpainting/upscaling pages (see their settings pages), or how to share logs and debug artifacts (see [How to Read and Share a Debug Run](../debugging/how-to-read-and-share-a-debug-run.md)).
- The settings pages record where each switch lives in the UI; this guide explains their role in model, GPU, and memory troubleshooting and the underlying behavior.

## Common symptoms and quick diagnosis {#symptoms}

| Symptom | Common cause | Where to start |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First use of a model stalls on download or reports hash verification failure | Network unreachable, fallback URLs also fail, corrupted file or content differs from the actual weights | Check the `models/` subdirectory and the actual hash printed in logs; see [Model loading and download](#model-loading) |
| CUDA/Metal device not found and automatic fallback to CPU | CPU dependency group installed, driver mismatch, or `cli.use_gpu` enabled while the device is unavailable | [Runtime Requirements](../install/requirements.md); `label_use_gpu` |
| ONNX model fails to load or has GPU compatibility issues | ONNX Runtime CUDA provider unavailable or DLL conflict | Enable `label_disable_onnx_gpu` to force CPU and check whether it recovers |
| CUDA out of memory / insufficient VRAM | Per-inference input too large, `inpainting_size` too large, or high peak usage from concurrency and caches | Reduce `inpainting_size`, enable `tile_size`, disable concurrency, enable the unload switch |
| Memory/VRAM does not drop after a task | Model instances stay cached, Python and CUDA caches are not reclaimed | Enable `app.unload_models_after_translation`; inspect the `[显存]` snapshot in verbose logs |

## Relevant switches in the UI {#ui-controls}

### Settings → General {#general-group}

Open “Settings” (`Settings`) and select the “General” (`General`) group. The three switches all live in this group:

1. “Use GPU” (`Use GPU`) requests GPU acceleration. It only changes the runtime device; it cannot turn a CPU dependency environment into CUDA.
2. “Disable ONNX GPU Acceleration” (`Disable ONNX GPU Acceleration`) disables only the ONNX Runtime GPU path and forces CPU.
3. “Unload Models After Translation” (`Unload Models After Translation`) controls model unloading and memory reclamation after each task; when enabled, the next task reloads the models.

### Other relevant settings {#other-settings}

- Inpainting size `inpainter.inpainting_size`: Settings → Mask and Inpainting. The default is `2048`; a value that is too large directly causes insufficient VRAM.
- Upscaling tiles `upscale.tile_size`: Settings → Upscale / Colorization. `0` processes the full image without tiling; tiling significantly lowers peak VRAM.
- Concurrent batches `cli.batch_concurrent`: Settings → General. Concurrency loads intermediate results of multiple images at once and raises peak VRAM/RAM; disable it when VRAM is limited.

## Key settings {#key-settings}

> For the mapping of each parameter's UI name, stored key, and default value, see the [UI Options Reference](../reference/options-i18n-matrix.md).

#### Use GPU {#cli-use-gpu}

The “Use GPU” switch lives in the “Settings → General” group and requests GPU acceleration. It only changes the runtime device selection; it cannot turn a CPU dependency environment into CUDA. When on, the UI shows “Use GPU”; when off there is no separate UI label, it simply means GPU is not requested.

#### Disable ONNX GPU Acceleration {#cli-disable-onnx-gpu}

The “Disable ONNX GPU Acceleration” switch lives in the “Settings → General” group and disables only the ONNX Runtime GPU path, forcing CPU; it does not affect PyTorch/MPS models. When on, the UI shows “Disable ONNX GPU Acceleration”; when off, ONNX may use the CUDA provider.

#### Unload Models After Translation {#app-unload-models-after-translation}

The “Unload Models After Translation” switch lives in the “Settings → General” group and controls model unloading and memory reclamation after each task; when enabled, the next task reloads the models and the first response is slower. When on, the UI shows “Unload Models After Translation”; when off, model instances are kept after the task.

## Why it happens {#runtime-behavior}

### Model loading and download {#model-loading}

The model root is `BASE_PATH/models` (`BASE_PATH` is the repository root in development and the executable directory in frozen builds). Detection, OCR, inpainting, upscaling, colorization, and translation use separate subdirectories. Loading first checks whether the files are downloaded: if missing, it downloads from the URL list in the module’s model mapping, computes SHA-256, and compares it with the `hash` entry; a mismatch raises a verification error and prints the actual hash in logs. Only after the files are ready does it move the weights onto the target device.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["load(device)"] --> B{"Model files downloaded?"}
    B -->|no| C["Download from URL list (switch to fallback URLs on failure)"]
    C --> D{"SHA-256 matches mapping?"}
    D -->|no| E["ModelVerificationException: log prints the actual hash"]
    D -->|yes| F{"Model already loaded?"}
    B -->|yes| F
    F -->|no| G{"use_gpu enabled and CUDA/MPS available?"}
    G -->|yes| H["_load onto cuda / mps"]
    G -->|no| I["Warn and fall back to cpu"]
    H --> J["_loaded=True, forward can run"]
    I --> J
```

On download failure or hash mismatch, first check the network and permissions of the `models/` directory, then compare the actual hash printed in logs against the mapping or delete corrupted files and retry. Do not copy local paths from download directories or logs into public reports.

### GPU and VRAM {#gpu-and-vram}

Device selection happens during initialization: with `use_gpu=True` and an available device it selects `cuda`/`mps`, otherwise it falls back to `cpu` with a warning. The ONNX runtime prefers `CUDAExecutionProvider` unless disabled, and a missing provider or failed session creation automatically falls back to `CPUExecutionProvider`. Both the desktop app and the CLI set `PYTORCH_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` before importing PyTorch to reduce fragmentation and lower the chance of OOM. In verbose mode, VRAM snapshots are written to logs with the `[显存]` prefix (allocated/reserved/peak/free) to locate stage-by-stage growth.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["GPU-mode runtime error"] --> B{"CUDA or MPS available?"}
    B -->|no| C["Fall back to CPU with warning"]
    B -->|yes| D{"Is the current model ONNX?"}
    D -->|yes| E{"disable_onnx_gpu enabled?"}
    E -->|yes| F["Force CPUExecutionProvider"]
    E -->|no| G["Try CUDAExecutionProvider"]
    G -->|failed| H["Fall back to CPU and log a warning"]
    D -->|no| I{"CUDA OOM / insufficient VRAM?"}
    I -->|yes| J["Reduce inpainting_size / enable tile_size / disable concurrency"]
    I -->|no| K["Use the verbose [显存] snapshot to locate the stage"]
    J --> L["Unload unused models or enable the unload switch, then retry"]
```

Whether OOM occurs also depends on image size, `batch_concurrent`, and other processes on the same machine; enabling tiling or the unload switch does not guarantee that no model ever reports OOM.

### Unloading and memory reclamation {#memory-cleanup}

“Unload Models After Translation” triggers a full memory cleanup after a desktop task finishes; the core translator also cleans up per batch: normal cleanup does throttled garbage collection and CUDA synchronization, while aggressive mode also empties GPU caches; MPS has no equivalent cache-clearing API.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Off["Unload Models After Translation off"]
        O1["Task ends"] --> O2["Clear intermediate contexts and batch caches"]
        O2 --> O3["Model instances stay; next task is faster"]
    end
    subgraph On["Unload Models After Translation on"]
        P1["Task ends"] --> P2["Unload translator/OCR/detection/inpainting/upscaling/colorization instances"]
        P2 --> P3["gc.collect + cuda.empty_cache + Windows working-set reclaim"]
        P3 --> P4["More thorough VRAM/RAM release, but next task must reload"]
    end
```

Enabling unload does not mean VRAM used by third-party processes (browsers, other PyTorch programs) is returned immediately, nor that system RAM usage drops to zero at once; it mainly releases the models and caches held by this process.

### Idle unloading in server modes {#idle-unload}

The `web`, `ws`, and `shared` modes support `--models-ttl` (seconds, default `0`). When greater than `0`, a background cleanup task unloads models idle longer than the TTL; `0` keeps models resident. The desktop app does not use this CLI parameter; its behavior is controlled by “Unload Models After Translation”.

## Related settings and limitations {#dependencies}

- GPU acceleration depends on the backend group and drivers selected at install time; with the wrong group or drivers, `cli.use_gpu` only triggers a fallback instead of fixing the environment; see [Runtime Requirements](../install/requirements.md).
- An oversized `inpainting_size` directly causes OOM; `upscale.tile_size` tiling lowers upscaling peak VRAM; `cli.batch_concurrent` raises concurrent peaks, so disable it when VRAM is limited.
- `cli.disable_onnx_gpu` affects only the ONNX path; PyTorch/MPS models still select their device through `cli.use_gpu`.
- Enabling `app.unload_models_after_translation` costs reload time on the next task; it and `models_ttl` are different entry points (desktop switch vs server-mode CLI parameter).
- RAM limits (subprocess RSS / whole-machine memory) are a different class from VRAM; see [Subprocess, Memory, and Recovery](../cli/subprocess-memory-and-recovery.md).
- `cli.ignore_errors` decides whether a per-image failure is skipped or aborts the task; CUDA OOM has no dedicated friendly Chinese message, and task logs keep the original traceback. Clean logs before sharing per [Privacy, Cleanup, and Log Sharing](./privacy-cleanup-and-log-sharing.md).
